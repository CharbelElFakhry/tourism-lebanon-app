st.markdown("""
## Introduction

What do we remember every single Lebanese summer?  
**Mountains, beaches, food, and festivals!**  
And of course, the restaurants : each season they invest a lot in marketing, 
launch new locations, reinvent their menus, and craft irresistible offers.  

But have we ever stopped to ask: **what is the real impact of restaurants on a townâ€™s tourism?**  

In this application, using Lebanonâ€™s tourism dataset, we explore **how restaurants shape the tourism performance of towns and regions**.  
Through interactive visualizations, we identify the **Top restaurant hubs**, analyze their **tourism scores**, and compare patterns across **districts and governorates**.  
The goal is to uncover interesting insights and start a discussion on the role of restaurants within Lebanonâ€™s broader tourism story.

## 0) About the Dataset

Before diving into the story, letâ€™s briefly look at the dataset we are using.  
It was created by **Christian Gharzouzi** on *September 4, 2024* and is linked to the dataset 
**Tourism-Lebanon-2023**.

**Dataset details:**
- **Issued on:** 2024-09-04  
- **Scope:** Tourism data for Lebanon at the **Governorate, District, and Town** levels  
- **Shape:** (1137 rows Ã— 22 columns)  
- **Measures included:**  
  - Total number of restaurants, hotels, cafes, and guest houses  
  - Existence of tourism attractions that could be exploited or developed  
  - Existence of initiatives and projects in the past five years to improve the tourism sector  
  - Indicators showing whether restaurants, hotels, cafes, or guest houses exist in a given town  

This dataset gives us a structured way to explore **how infrastructure and services 
are distributed across Lebanonâ€™s towns and regions**, and how they might relate 
to tourism performance.

### Analysis

Looking at the **Top 10 towns by number of restaurants**, we immediately notice a **large variability**:  
- The leading town hosts **100 restaurants**,  
- While the 10th-ranked town has only about **40**.  

This gap shows how **unevenly distributed** restaurants are across Lebanese towns.  
And if we zoom out to consider **all towns in Lebanon**, the variability in restaurant numbers 
is even more hilighted, ranging from towns with dozens of restaurants to others with very few or none at all.

### Analysis

From the distribution of areas among the **Top 10 towns by restaurants**, 
we see that **3 of these towns belong to Baabda District**.  

This shows that **Baabda stands out geographically**, as multiple top-performing towns 
are located within the same district.  

It suggests that restaurants (and potentially tourism activity) are not only concentrated

### Analysis

From this visualization, we can see that **there is some positive relationship** between the 
**total number of restaurants in a town** and its **Tourism Index**.  
Although the correlation is not perfect, the regression line shows 
that towns with **more restaurants tend to score higher on tourism performance**.  

This supports the idea that a **nice food scene contributes to tourism appeal**. 
However, since variability remains high, it tells us that restaurants are **only one of several factors** 
that affect tourism in towns.

### Analysis

On the **regional side**, when comparing districts and governorates, we check whether 
the **Top 10 restaurant towns** show the same relationship at a broader scale.  

What we quickly notice is that regions containing towns with many restaurants 
**do not always display uniform tourism performance**. Often there is just one 
outstanding town driving the numbers.  

For example:  
- **Byblos** and **Matn** districts appear early in the plot, **below the mid-range**, 
  showing relatively low Tourism Index performance.  
- **Baabda**, which contains three of the Top 10 towns, comes directly after Byblos and Matn, 
  also not among the top performers.  
- Only **Nabatieh Governorate** ranks close to the highest-performing region.  

This tells us that the **town-level relationship** (more restaurants â†’ higher Tourism Index) 
does not necessarily translate to the **regional level**.  
A high number of restaurants in towns may be tied instead to **town-specific factors** 
such as marketing campaigns, festivals, or unique local attractions.
""")

st.markdown("""
## Conclusion

As this Lebanese summer comes to an end, so does our journey of exploring how **restaurants 
and tourism performance** connect across towns and regions.  

Hereâ€™s what we found:  
- Even within the Top 10 towns, the restaurant counts range widely, from nearly 100 in the top town down to around 40 in the last one.  
- Multiple of these towns are concentrated in just a few **districts**, indicating at geographic clustering.  
- At the **town level**, more restaurants often associated with a higher **Tourism Index**, 
  though not always. This shows that having restaurants alone doesn't guarantee success.  
- At the **regional level**, the pattern weakens: some districts with top towns (like Byblos, Matn, and Baabda) 
  low tourism indices, while others (like Nabatieh) perform well.  

In short, while Lebanonâ€™s vibrant food scene is a key ingredient for tourism, the full recipe 
also depends on **many other factors** â€” such as marketing campaigns, seasonal festivals, 
infrastructure, or unique attractions. Some of these factors might not be captured in the dataset 
we used, but they still play a crucial role in shaping the countryâ€™s tourism story each summer.
